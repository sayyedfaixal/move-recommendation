# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system built using the TMDB dataset, which contains data on 5000 movies. The system recommends movies based on content similarity, leveraging the Streamlit framework for the frontend.

## Features

- **Dataset**: The TMDB dataset, consisting of 5000 movies, was used to develop this recommendation system.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by removing null values to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Selection**: Performed feature selection to retain only the most useful features for the recommendation system.
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Utilized cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies, allowing for effective content-based recommendations.
- **Frontend**: Built the frontend using the Streamlit framework, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for the recommendation system.

## Libraries Used

- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing cosine similarity and other machine learning utilities.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive frontend of the application.

## How to Run the Project
